For most of the blogs I read, the null and alternative hypothesis were discussed based on the population mean and the sample mean. To test the hypothesis one can use one-sample t-test. But here I would like to discuss the two-sample or independent t-test where we test two independent samples. To make it more clear we use the `scipy` library to conduct the t-test
As an example discussed above, weâ€™ll test whether the average height of males in the US is different from those in the EU using Python. Assume we have two datasets: one for the US and one for the EU.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Simulated heights (in cm) for males in the US and EU
us_heights = np.random.normal(loc=175, scale=8, size=100)  # Mean=175, SD=10
eu_heights = np.random.normal(loc=174, scale=8, size=100)  # Mean=170, SD=10
```

The distribution of these two height more or less looks the same, with almost the same mean. Now let's perform the t-test. For two-sample t-test we have consider the half of the p-value.
```python
# Perform an independent t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(us_heights, eu_heights)

# Set significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Output results
print(f"T-statistic: {t_stat}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")

if p_value/2 < alpha:
    print("We reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in average heights.")
else:
    print("We fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant difference in average heights.")
```
output:
`T-statistic: 40.020422168327485`
`P-value: 0.0`
`We reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in average heights.`
`t-critical:1.6451077126390887`
