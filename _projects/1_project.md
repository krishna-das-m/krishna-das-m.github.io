This project was in collaboration with ETH Zurich where I was a Doctoral candidate. The project was about "Signed Relations and Structural Balance in Complex Systems: From Data to Models".
As a part of this project, I was working with Objective 2: Modeling interactions in signed networks and their evolution, where I worked on Group formation and balance in multiplex networks ({% cite mohandas2024paradise %}, {% cite mohandas2024critical %})
