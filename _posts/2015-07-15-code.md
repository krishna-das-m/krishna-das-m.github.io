In this post, we’ll explore the relationship between **prior distribution**, **likelihood**, and **posterior distribution** using a practical example.
#### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's the formula:
\begin{equation}
\overbrace{P(hypothesis | evidence)}^{\text{posterior}} = \frac{\overbrace{P(evidence| hypothesis)}^{\text{likelihood}} \overbrace{P(hypothesis)}^{\text{prior}}}{\underbrace{P(evidence)}_{\text{marginal}}}
\end{equation}

Where:
- **Posterior**: The updated probability of having the disease, given the test result.
- **Likelihood**: The probability of the test result, given the person has the disease.
- **Prior**: The initial probability of having the disease before the test.
- **Evidence**: The overall probability of the test result (positive or negative).

#### The Scenario

Let’s walk through an example.

Suppose you visit your doctor and get tested for a rare disease. Unfortunately, the test result is positive. Naturally, you want to know: "Given the positive result, what is the probability that I actually have the disease?" Since no medical test is 100% accurate, Bayes' Theorem helps us answer this question.
In the context of our current scenario, when comparing it to the general form of Bayes' Theorem, the hypothesis we are testing is that a person has the disease (i.e., they test positive for it). The evidence corresponds to the observed data, specifically the results from the tests that indicate a positive outcome.

#### Breaking Down the Terms:

1. **Prior Probability, $$P(Disease)$$**:  
   This is the probability of having the disease before considering the test result. It represents the incidence of the disease in the general population.  
   For example, if the disease affects 1 in 1000 people, then:\
   $$P(Disease) = 0.001$$

2. **Likelihood, $$P(+ | Disease)$$**:  
   This is the probability of testing positive, given that you already have the disease. In other words, it’s the accuracy of the test in detecting the disease when it is present.  
   Let’s assume the test has an accuracy of 99%, so:\
   $$P(+ | Disease) = 0.99$$

3. **Marginal, $$P(+)$$**:  
   This is the overall probability of testing positive, regardless of whether the person has the disease. It includes both true positives and false positives.\
   It is calculated as:\
   $$P(+) = P(Disease) P(+ | Disease) + P(Healthy) P(+ | Healthy)$$\
   Here, $$P(Healthy) = 1 - P(Disease) = 0.999$$, and $$P(+ | Healthy)$$ is the probability of NOT having the disease and falsely identified positive by the test (1% = 0.01). So:\
   $$P(+ | Healthy) = 0.01$$

4. **Posterior Probability, $$P(Disease | +)$$**:  
   This is the updated probability of having the disease, given that the test result is positive. Using Bayes' Theorem, we can compute this as:\
   $$P(Disease | +) = \frac{P(Disease) P(+ | Disease)}{P(+) }$$
   Plugging in the values:\
   $$P(Disease | +) = \frac{0.001 \times 0.99}{(0.001 \times 0.99) + (0.999 \times 0.01)} = 0.09016$$\
   So, the probability that you actually have the disease, even after testing positive, is about **9%**.

 Now where do the distribution plots of prior, likelihood and posterior come from?
 Before diving into how we obtain the distributions for the **prior**, **likelihood**, and **posterior**, let’s introduce a change of variable to make the equation more intuitive. We’ll substitute **Disease** with **$$\theta$$**, which represents the probability that a person from the population will test positive. This allows us to express **Bayes' Theorem** as:\
 \begin{equation}
 P(\theta|+)=\frac{P(+|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(+)}
 \end{equation}
 Our goal is to estimate the parameter **$$\theta$$**, which is the probability that a random individual will test positive for the disease. To make this concept more concrete, let's simulate a scenario where we conduct a total of 10 tests, out of which 2 people are positive (we’ll call this a **success**).

 ```python
 # Create bernoulli trials
 N = 10 #total trials
 nDisease = 2 # success

 # Create a list with Disease (D) and Healthy (H) results
 trials = ["D"] * nDisease + ["H"] * (N - nDisease)

 # Shuffle the sequence to randomize the order of trials
 random.shuffle(trials)

 print(trials)
 ['H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'H', 'D', 'H', 'D']
 ```

#### **The Prior Distribution**
Let’s assume we don’t have any specific information about the proportion of people who have the disease, so we don’t know the exact value of $$P(\theta)$$. Instead of assuming a single fixed value, we’ll consider a range of possible values for $$P(\theta)$$.\
To account for this uncertainty, we’ll generate 10 random values between 0 and 1, which will represent potential probabilities for the prevalence of the disease in the population. This helps us explore various possible scenarios when estimating the likelihood of having the disease based on a positive test result.\
Here’s how we generate these random values:\
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import beta

# Disease = np.random.random(10)
start, stop, N = 0.0, 1.0, 10
h = (stop-start)/N
theta = np.arange(start, stop, h)
```

At this stage, `theta` contains a set of values representing possible probabilities of having the disease. However, these values don’t yet form a probability distribution because the sum of $$P(\theta)$$ is not equal to 1. If desired, we could adjust the range of `theta` (for example, using values from 0 to 10), but in that case, we would need to normalize the values.

Next, we need to choose a distribution for the **prior**. A suitable choice is the **beta distribution**, which is defined over the interval $$[0, 1]$$, making it perfect for modeling probabilities like $$\theta$$.

We can specify the prior distribution using the beta distribution:
```python
# Define prior distribution
a , b= 10, 10
dist = beta(a, b)
Ptheta = dist.pdf(theta)
# Normalize so that values sum to 1
Ptheta = Ptheta / sum(Ptheta)
# print(pTheta)
```

The array `Ptheta` gives us the prior probability distribution. This represents our **prior belief** about the possible values of $$P(\theta)$$ before observing any new data, such as the results of the test.

#### **The Likelihood**

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````

Which displays:

1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}
