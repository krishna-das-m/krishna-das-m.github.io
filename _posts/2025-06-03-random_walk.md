Random walks are among the most fundamental and elegant concepts in probability theory, with applications spanning from physics and biology to finance and computer science. At its core, a random walk describes a mathematical model where a particle or entity moves through space in a sequence of random steps.

## What is a Random Walk?

Imagine a person standing on a number line at position zero. At each time step, they flip a coin: heads means they take one step to the right (+1), tails means they take one step to the left (-1). After many coin flips, their position traces out what mathematicians call a simple random walk.

More formally, a random walk is a sequence of positions $$S_0$$, $$S_1$$, $$S_2$$, ... where:

$$S_0 = 0$$ (starting position)
$$S_n = S_0 + X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n$$

Here, each $$X_i$$ represents a random step, and the position at time n is simply the sum of all previous steps.

Let's implement a simple random walk in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def simple_random_walk(n_steps=100, n_dims=2):
    """Generate a simple random walk."""
    steps = np.random.choice([-1,0, 1], size=(n_steps, n_dims))
    origins = np.zeros((1, n_dims))
    paths = np.cumsum( steps, axis=0)
    paths = np.concatenate((origins, paths), axis=0)
    return paths
```

## Unbiased Random Walks

An unbiased random walk (also called a symmetric random walk) is one where each step has equal probability in all possible directions. In the simplest one-dimensional case:

$$P(step=+1)=1/2$$
$$P(step=-1)=1/2$$

The expected value of each step is zero: $$E[X_i]=(+1)\times (1/2) + (-1)\times (1/2)=0$$

### Key properties of unbiased random walks

- **Expected position:** The expected position at any time n is always zero. Even after thousands of steps, on average, the walker returns to where they started.
- **Variance and standard deviation:** While the expected position is zero, the variance grows linearly with time. For a simple random walk, $$Var(S_n) = n$$, which means the standard deviation is $$\sqrt{n}$$.
- **Recurrence:** In one and two dimensions, an unbiased random walk is recurrent - the walker will eventually return to their starting position with probability 1. However, in three or more dimensions, the walk becomes transient - there's a positive probability of never returning home.
- **Central Limit Theorem:** As n becomes large, the position Sâ‚™ approaches a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $$n$$.

## Biased random walks

A biased random walk introduces a drift or tendency to move in a particular direction. Instead of equal probabilities, we might have:

$$P(step=+1)=p$$
$$P(step=-1)=q=1-p$$

When $$p \neq 1/2$$, the walk becomes biasd. The expected value of each step is now $$E[X_i]=(+1)\times p + (-1)\times (1-p)=2p-1$$

### Key Properties of Biased Random Walks

- **Drift:** The expected position after $$n$$ steps is $$n(2p - 1)$$. If $$p > 1/2$$, the walk drifts toward positive values; if $$p < 1/2$$, it drifts toward negative values.
- **Recurrence vs. Transience:** Unlike unbiased walks, biased random walks in one dimension are transient - they don't necessarily return to their starting point. The stronger the bias, the less likely a return becomes.
- **Long-term Behavior:** With positive bias $$(p > 1/2)$$, the position grows roughly linearly with time, eventually heading toward positive infinity.
